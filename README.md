Welcome to our trivia game of Smile CommUNITY developed in Python/Flask, HTML and CSS on Cloud9 IDE!

This is part of GWC at Downers Grove Public Library. The course ran from January to May of 2017. We met 2 hours/week at the library. 

If you've never looked at the tutorial or are interested in learning Python,
go check it out. It's a great hands-on way for learning all about programming
in Python.

## Starting from the Terminal

To try the example application, type the following in the terminal:

```
pip install Flask

Alternatively, open the app.py file and click the green Run
